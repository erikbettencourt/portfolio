            <p class="subtitle max-width">Lutron's digital ecosystem had become fragmented over time, with disparate tools, siloed data, and complex workflows creating friction for residential and commercial customers. To enhance the customer experience, we led an initiative to unify these systems, streamline operations, and develop a scalable platform that would empower users to manage projects more efficiently.</p>

          <p class="max-width, subtitle">Understanding customer friction was at the heart of our approach. Through cross-functional collaboration, we brought together teams from product, sales, engineering, and customer experience to uncover key pain points and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>

                <h3>Identifying Customer Friction & Building Consensus</h3>
                <p>To build a unified and efficient digital experience, we first needed to deeply understand the challenges faced by Lutron’s customers. Through weekly cross-functional workshops, we mapped the end-to-end customer journey, identifying pain points, workflow inefficiencies, and operational bottlenecks that created frustration for residential dealers and commercial sales teams.</p>

                <p>The findings from our discovery work extended far beyond product development—they informed broader company-wide strategic initiatives. By surfacing inefficiencies and disconnects across multiple teams, we helped drive operational improvements that reduced internal friction, enhanced collaboration, and created a more cohesive ecosystem for both employees and customers.</p>

            <p class="max-width">To ensure that our solutions truly addressed user needs, we implemented a rapid prototyping process with continuous customer feedback loops. Using storyboards and low-fidelity product sketches, we tested and validated concepts early, refining designs based on real-world input. This iterative process allowed us to engage users, gain quick validation, and adjust solutions in real time.</p>

          <p class="section-intro max-width">As our solutions took shape, business leaders faced a key decision: invest in proprietary technology or integrate off-the-shelf solutions. To guide this, we conducted a build vs. buy analysis, evaluating cost, scalability, speed to market, and long-term value.</p>
          <p class="section-intro max-width">We modeled multiple scenarios, helping stakeholders determine where to build for innovation and differentiation, where to buy for rapid deployment and efficiency, and where to integrate to balance cost-effectiveness with tailored functionality. This structured approach ensured Lutron's technology investments aligned with business objectives and customer needs.</p>
